# 1. Ask for your three values.

    # ================================================================== PROCESS
    # 2. Work out the difference and the percentage.       [Typical and above]
    difference = limit - value   # replace with your calculation
    percent = (value / limit) * 100       # replace with your calculation
    # 3. Decide a status and store it in a variable called status.
    #
    #    Threshold : if / else        -> "OVER LIMIT" or "OK"
    #    Typical   : if / elif / else -> "OVER LIMIT" (100% or more),
    #                                     "WARNING" (90% or more), otherwise "OK"
    if percent >= 100:

    elif percent >= 90:
        status = "WARNING"
    else:
        status = "OK"   # replace with your if / else (or if / elif / else)


    # =================================================================== OUTPUT
    # 4. Print the report.
    #
    #    Threshold : the three values you were given, plus status, inside a border
    #    Typical   : add difference and percent, 2 decimal places, right-aligned
    #    Excellent : wrap sections 1-4 in a loop so you can check as many records
    #                as you like in one run - type "quit" as the label to stop.
    #                Keep count of how many came back OVER LIMIT and print that
    #                once, after the loop ends.

    print()

# 5. Before you finish:
#
#    [ ] Run it three times with different numbers
#    [ ] Run it with a total of 0 and note the error (do not fix it yet)
#    [ ] Check every variable name says what it holds
